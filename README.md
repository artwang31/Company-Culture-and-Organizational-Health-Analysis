# Company Culture and Organizational-Health-Analysis
Managed and conducted the entire data cycle and processes to analyze company's organizational health.  

**ALL PERSONAL AND/OR UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM ALL SAMPLE DATA**  

**Goal and Purpose:**

For this project I had to run a comprehensive annual organizational health/company culture analysis that seeks to determine staff sentiment towards the company, their supervisors, and whether employees believe the company is achieving their stated objectives. In this report, I examine and analyze staff culture and sentiment over time and through demographic lines to get a more holisitic view of our staff and how they are feeling.

**Context:** 

When a company is big, it is often times difficult to ascertain how your staff is feeling towards their work, company, and career. Therefore, I needed to create this organizational health report that included an interactive Tableau visualization and PowerPoint deck.

**Methodology:**

I wanted this analysis to be as comprehensive as possible as this would be the only time in the year for me to gather information about our staff. Because the company consists of 3000+ employees, it is often difficult for senior level decision makers to get a sense of how their staff are feeling and 
whether they feeling satisfied with their jobs/roles within the company.

I met with stakeholders from a variety of different teams, spoke to psychometricians, and led meetings to ascertain the types of questions that would best help us understand the pulse of the company and the feelings of our staff. 

Once these meetings were conducted and the relevant questions confirmed, I created an extensive Company Culture/Organizational Health Survey in Qualtrics to mine/gather this data. A sample of the survey questions asked in this survey were (in a quantitative scale):

   - At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best everyday.
   - I am learning and developing my position.
   - I am supported in pursuing my personal priorities. 
   - I feel positive about working at my company.
   - I would recommend my company to my friends.
   - Staff morale within my department is positive. 
   
These questions were a sample of the staff culture/organizational health questions that I gathered responses for. Finally, after I cleaned, processed, and pivoted the data, I created an interactive visualization in Tableau for stakeholders to utilize and make decisions on. 

**Final Report:**

The Tableau report had many dashboards in which users could toggle and interact with the data. This report helped cabinet level colleagues understand how their staff were feeling and answered numerous questions they had about staff sentiment. The annual organizational health report also provided a view of sentiment and feeling over time, which allows for checks on company initiatives and direction.  

**Take Aways**

After working on this project, I applied a regression model on these questions and its relation to our staff retention numbers. I found that certain types of questions (those pertaining to staff feelings and sentiment) correlated most to staff retention. Now the business can definitively say, through data, that staff morale is positively correlated to staff retention. 

**The first visualization is a dashboard that displays the business/unit or division as it compares with others in the same company. If a user hovers the computer mouse over the text, a tooltip bar will appear that shows the division's change from last year.**

**The second visualization displays a longitudinal analysis of how the division's staff feels about the company over time. As with other reports, the user can filter the questions and the year on year view with a variety of demographic cuts.**

**The final visualization displays a macro level of view of the department/division as it compares with others in the same region or team. A user can similarly filter this macro view with other detailed cuts of data.**
