# Organizational-Health-Analysis
Managed and conducted the entire data cycle and processes to analyze company's organizational health.  

**ALL PERSONAL AND/OR UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM ALL SAMPLE DATA** 

**Goal and Purpose:**

My company creates a comprehensive annual organizational health analysis that seeks to determine staff sentiment towards the company, company culture, and
whether the company is achieving their stated objectives. We examine and analyze staff culture and sentiment over time and through demographic lines to get a more holisitic view of our staff.

**Context:** 

This report, visualized in Tableau, ultimately helped my company understand the company's culture and staff sentiment for a given year.

Because the company consists of 3000+ employees, it is often difficult for senior level decision makers to get a sense of how their staff are feeling and 
whether they feel they are feeling satisfied with their jobs/roles within the company. This is why I needed to create this organizational health report that included an interactive Tableau visualization and PowerPoint deck.

**Methodology:**

I wanted this analysis to be as comprehensive as possible as this would be the only time in the year for me to gather information about our staff and how they are feeling about the company.

I met with stakeholders from a variety of different teams, spoke to psychometricians, and led meetings to ascertain the types of questions that would best help us understand the pulse of the company and the feelings of our staff. 

Once these meetings were conducted and the relevant questions decied, I created an extensive Organizational Health Survey in Qualtrics to mine/gather this data. A sample of the survey questions asked in this survey were (in a quantitative scale):

   - At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best everyday.
   - I am learning and developing my position.
   - I am supported in pursuing my personal priorities. 
   - I feel positive about working at my company.
   - I would recommend my company to my friends.
   - Staff morale within my department is positive. 
   
These questions were a sample of the staff culture/organizational health questions that I gathered responses to. More importantly, after performing a linear-regression model on these questions and our staff retention numbers, I realized that these types of questions correlated most to staff retention. That staff morale was indeed correlated to staff retention. 

Finally, after I cleaned, processed, and pivoted the data, I created an interactive visualization in Tableau for stakeholders to utilize and make decision on. 

**Final Report:**

The Tableau report had many dashboards in which users could toggle and play with the data. This report helped cabinet level colleagues understand how their staff were feeling and answered numerous questions they had about staff sentiment. The annual organizational health report also provided a view of sentiment and feeling over time, which allows for checks on company initiatives and direction.
